![PreviewGram Screenshot](./assets/ppg_printsc.png)

PreviewGram protects you when:

- Disables JavaScript when Browsing
  - Doesn't store cookies
  - Doesn't run trackers
- Uses a generic Chrome user-agent
- Doesn't use Telegram's API
- Doesn't require a Account

Useful Features:

## Limitations

PreviewGram isn't the perfection on Earth. Because:

1. Doesn't use JavaScript
2. It's limited by the Telegram's Preview Site itself.

So, PreviewGram can't:

- Hide your IP*
- Play videos**
- See Group Chats***
- Download files directly*** (instead this, do:
`RMB**** > Copy link address` and download on Telegram App)

> - \* Use a VPN or Proxy. Read <br>
> [`Why PreviewGram doesn't use Tor's Proxy by itself?`](#why-previewgram-doesnt-use-tors-proxy-by-itself) <br>
> - \*\* Because JavaScript is disabled
> - \*\*\* Preview website limitation
> - \*\*\*\* RMB is Right Mouse Button

## Tips

- Always use Vpn or Proxy
- To open links, do `RMB* > Copy link address`
- If you want to watch videos,
please use Tor** (or any Browser that you trust)
- Click on `Test privacy!` button to test for yourself. It's tested by [What Is My Browser](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/)
\*\*\* 

> - \* RMB is Right Mouse Button <br>
> - \*\* Read [`Accessing via Tor`](#accessing-via-tor) <br>

## VPN, Proxy and Tor

### Differences

#### Proxy

> Proxy is your online ID, hiding you real IP Address.
> It's a intermediary between your Web Browser and the internet,
> a web site for example. (Needs to be configured per-app basis)

#### VPN

> VPN covers 100% of you device traffic, encrypting the connection.
> It'll hide your real IP Address.

#### The Onion Route (Tor)

> Tor anonymizes your traffic sending it through a series of proxies,
> this proxies are called Nodes, that encrypts the traffic and
> sends to destiny using a Exit Node.

### Why PreviewGram doesn't use Tor's Proxy by itself

Tor have some issues, and
isn't recommended to use Tor outside TorBrowser to avoid DNS Leaks and
VPN+TOR issues.

### But What The Füò°üò°üò° talking about Tor, if PreviewGram doesn't use it???

> Because you can Access the channels via Tor
> 
> Yep, you don't need this application if you have Tor... üôÉ

#### Accessing via Tor

1. Create a "Telegram Channels" Folder on Bookmarks
  - ![Create Folder](./assets/bookmarks.png)
2. To access your favorite channel, put a ``/s/`` between the domain and
channel name,
example: `https://t.me/previewgram` to `https://t.me/s/previewgram`
3. Save to "Telegram Channels"'s Bookmark Folder
  - ![Save to BookMark](./assets/open.png)
4. Access when you want!
5. **Extra:** make [Tor portable](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/make-tor-portable/)
and use the [Mobile Tor Browser](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/mobile-tor/)
to use everywhere.

## Telegram Privacy Issues

- According to VPN Mentor,
Telegram "Telegram is Not as Private as it Claims" saying
that they "operates with zero transparency":

  - [Law Enforcement Authorities](https://telegram.org/privacy#8-3-law-enforcement-authorities)
- In 2020, Telegram suffered a data leak:
  - Source: [Millions of Telegram Users‚Äô Data Exposed on Darknet - CoinTelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/millions-of-telegram-userss-data-exposed-on-darknet)
  - It isn't a Telegram specific problem.
Read [`Osint Problems`](#osint-problems), because: ‚ÄúUnfortunately,
any contacts-based app faces the challenge of
malicious users trying to upload many phone numbers and
build databases that match them with user IDs ‚Äì like this one.‚Äù
\- Telegram representative to CoinTelegraph
  - **Tip:** hide your phone number on Telegram's configurations.
- Telegram added Group Read Receipts:

> As any Social Network app, Telegram suffers with
[Osint](#osint-problems) (Open-Source Intelligence),
be caution with the information that you exposes publicly about yourself!

## Osint Problems

### What is Osint

Yeah, it's the information era, 500 millions tweets are published every day. 
Public information like birthday, complete name, 
age are available on internet published by its own users. 
Which in itself poses privacy risks.

> "Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is a multi-factor 
(qualitative, quantitative)
methodology for collecting, analyzing and
making decisions about data accessible in
publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context."
> Source: [Open-Source Intelligence - Wikiless](https://wikiless.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence?lang=en)

So, caution with your public information! üòâ
